{metric}
========

An **in-progress** alternative to Excel I'm building to keep track of different metrics for self-improvement. Could probably be used for other things too. 

Key points:
 - unlike Excel, we don't do tables
 - we do metrics and records
 - metrics are dynamically computed, a record is just a JSON object
 - it's all built with web tech, it's real-time using Meteor

## Install
 1. Install [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)
 2. Clone the project
 3. Run `meteor` and open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Let's call it GPLv3 for now...
