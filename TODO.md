TODO before v1.0.0
==================

**Get this sorted** so I can start using it in daily life for goals and tracking.

## Add record
 - show records in table

## Add metric
 - have the metric result reactively update (make the cursor a reactive data source) - e.g. https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-real-time-twitter-stream-with-node-and-react-js with componentDidMount

## Add Metric
 - then a metric subscribes to changes and recomputes when they happen.
 - add the nice DSL for averaging and such

## Home
 - show a nice pretty dashboard with metrics and records shown (http://liamz.tumblr.com/image/116297049576)
